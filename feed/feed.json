      "content_html": "<h4 id=\"featured-dark-lords%3A\">Featured Dark Lords: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#featured-dark-lords%3A\">#</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Elseia of the Grove (normal)</li>\n<li>Dark Disciple Eliza (heroic)</li>\n<li>Dark Disciple Ash (legendary)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"considerations%3A\">Considerations: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#considerations%3A\">#</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Event boost: Abyssal Gate has been upgraded for this event - each time you successfully clear the encounter during this limited period, it jumps 2 levels instead of 1 at a time, so you can gain twice the rewards (However, the reduction in levels per loss/retreat will double as well).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dark Disciple Ancient Weapon Ticket Shards will begin dropping from Levels 51 onwards! The shards can be saved across future abyssal gate events to form Dark Disciple Ancient Weapon Tickets!!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rem and Sora are added to premium summons and receive insignia transmute talent</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"event-guide%3A\">Event Guide: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#event-guide%3A\">#</a></h4>\n<p>This event is designed to help progressing players clear story mode difficulties and trials while getting event currency and achievements. A player is advised to progress finishing <strong>Act 5 Legendary Difficulty</strong> and afterwards <strong>all story trials</strong>. Once that is done best farm spot is <strong>30-3 Legendary</strong> for loot and Ash gates. It is advised to farm heroic difficulty for the Eliza/Elseia trials after you are done with Ash on legendary.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use Express tickets X1 per gate</strong> - doing so will maximise your energy quota for finding gates quickly, X3 will only open one gate so you are missing out on 2 extra chances if you X3.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stack as much energy before burning energy on gates</strong> - doing so will increase the number of times you can find one specific gate you are after.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep the useless gates open and farm your requirement first</strong> - gates remain open for 1 hour so holding back on killing <em>Elseia</em> and <em>Eliza</em> will enable you to find more <em>Ash</em> gates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Save 600 gems and buy the Keys Essential Calendar Special before event is over</strong> - gives 200x prestige points for gems, 25x stun and skill delay potions and 20x job keys.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"recommended-setup%3A\">Recommended setup: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#recommended-setup%3A\">#</a></h4>\n<p>After Ash level 50 gate damage output can one shot most rangers and on hit attacks have a chance to poison targets as well. Since the boss can dodge a lot it is recommended to go in with 1 taunt defender like Arthur and have at least 1 long range stun like 5 star Kane or 4 star Aron in Guan Yu aura to maximise stun potential to 2 triggers per attack round.</p>\n<p>Safest options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Holy Defender</strong> Arthur</strong> + <strong><strong>Paladin</strong> Guan Yu</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Grand Ranger</strong> Kane</strong> + <strong><strong>Gladiator</strong> Rhea</strong> + <strong><strong>Archbishop</strong> Snow White</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Archer Triangle</strong>: Kane/Aron + 2x Ash / Red Riding Hood / Cybelle / Luna</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rent priority:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong><strong>Gladtiator</strong> Rhea</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Valiants</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Event heroes</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the duration of this event a player should change profile hero to the strongest variant of the above priority.</p>\n<h4 id=\"long-term-event-strategy%3A\">Long term event strategy: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#long-term-event-strategy%3A\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Completing the event achievements rewards you with monster shard selectors. The only really good pick there is Nimue of the Lake, so make sure you pick her up. You get enough shards from the selectors to complete 1X 5 star Nimue from this event.</p>\n<p>The stun and skill delay potions from the 600 Keys calendar are invaluable during events that replicate Raid 2 boss mechanic and for finishing off hard Tower of Lost Souls trials now that floors 51-60 are open.</p>\n<p>Upgrading one Sora to 5 star and potentially equipping her for this event will increase her potential by 25%. She can be used with gwen and archer trigger or triangle to clear <strong>Gold Mine IV Trial 3</strong>.</p>\n<p>Players are advised to abstain from transmuting 1X 5 star Sora to insignia until gold mines are completed - doing so once will enable use of express tickets !</p>\n<h3 id=\"wheel-of-fortune-priority%3A\">Wheel of fortune priority: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#wheel-of-fortune-priority%3A\">#</a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dark Disciple Shards: Ash/Valerie &gt; Zoey/Cass &gt; rest.</strong> Prioritise the hero you are close to finishing and then get at least 1 Ash and Valerie for Raid 2 (Soul Curate Wheel)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equiment Enhancement</strong> (Soul Warden Wheel)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gold</strong> (Soul Guide Wheel)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
